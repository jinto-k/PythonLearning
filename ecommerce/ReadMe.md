<p>to create a package, we will have to create a directory </p>

<p>after that __init__ file has to be added</p>

<p> then we can import it and use it

<div>

<b>example</b> <br> <br>
import ecommerce.shipping as ship

from ecommerce.shipping import calc_shipping

from ecommerce import shipping

shipping.calc_shipping()
</div>
